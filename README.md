# Pickleball
Some code to numerically solve the differential equations of pickleball motion and plot them. 

All code related to actually solving the differential equations is contained in `pickleball_solving.py`. Some plots are generated in `pickleball_plotting.py` to demonstrate how plotting was achieved. 

Actual plots for the paper were generated with the (ugly) code in the paper-plots branch.
